# Info 
## How wishes are integrated:
Any accepted wish or item on the ToDo list can be submitted as a pull request by anyone. Code that achieves the desired goal will be integrated into the [Chaosaiart-Nodes](https://github.com/chaosaiart/Chaosaiart-Nodes). (Dev branch coming soon)

## How to create a new wish: 
1. Ensure that the wish does not exist in the New wishes or Rejected wishes sections.
2. Think of an extremely short text that describes your wish and a detailed version.
3. Create a New wish in the New wishes section structured as follows:
  "Author" and "Contact" are optional.
```
